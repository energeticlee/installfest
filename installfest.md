# Next Steps

For the next step of installation, we are going to use `brew install` to install the following:

- `brew install volta`
- `brew install --cask google-chrome`
- `brew install starship`
- `brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts`
- `brew install --cask font-fira-code-nerd-font` or any other nerd font
- `echo 'eval "$(starship init zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc`

# Windows users

To install node and startship use - [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/install) and just install node via that instead of volta
